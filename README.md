This is a basic stock screener where tickers are taken as an input and basic financial fundamentals are returned into console. Some are even calculated.

The goal of this little project is to retrieve information fast in order to skip the process of searching companies' fundamentals in different websites and reviewing securities that are not worth reviwing.
The ultimate goal for this project is to rank the securities based on those fundamentals in order to skip further review.

This project uses Yahoo's financial API and Intrinio's API to retrieve information.
